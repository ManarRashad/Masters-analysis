This study aims to integrate between different omics data of the host include RNA-seq data,
proteome data, metabolome data, and cytokines data with the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA)
microbiome data of gut and nasal cavity (nares) that were measured in prediabetic and control
samples to find out the common pathways between these omics data and identify the diagnostic
biomarkers for progression of the prediabetic patients to T2D.
